Why do I think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side
development?

The answer is pretty straight forward and simple imo.
It is simply due to the type safety of Typescript. Typescript adds static typing which catches issues at compile time as opposed to javascripts runtime, which is very important in building solana transaction instructions and other complex operations.

A secondary reason may be largely due to compatibility with web frameworks. Most web applications are written in Ts/Js (Client side).
